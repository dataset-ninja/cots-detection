**CSIRO COTS: The CSIRO Crown-of-Thorn Starfish Detection Dataset (a.k.a. TensorFlow - Help Protect the Great Barrier Reef Competition)** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the ecological research. 

The dataset consists of 23501 images with 11898 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*starfish*).

Images in the CSIRO COTS Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 18582 (79% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *train* (23501 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 image sets: ***video_2*** (8561 images), ***video_1*** (8232 images), and ***video_0*** (6708 images). Additionally, every image contains information about its ***sequence***, ***video_frame***, and ***sequence_frame***. The dataset was released in 2021 by the CSIRO, Australia, Queensland University of Technology, Australia, and Google, USA.
